#### Projects
- **Homemade Battery Powered Lightbulb**:  
  I developed cost-effective step-up inverter light bulbs powered by batteries to extend lighting availability in Indonesian homes without access to electricity. To ensure versatility and adaptability, I designed circuitry for two variations of the device capable of accommodating different battery sizes, allowing users to achieve varying levels of illumination based on their resources. As part of this initiative, I donated more than fifty units to local workers and children, providing reliable nighttime lighting that enhanced both productivity and safety within their communities.
