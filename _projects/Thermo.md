Experimental Investigation of a Water–Water Heat Exchanger

1.Introduction and Real-World Context
Heat exchangers are devices designed to transfer thermal energy between two fluids at different temperatures without mixing them. They are widely used in real-world systems such as radiators, HVAC systems, power plants, refrigeration units, and industrial chemical processes. In this experiment, a water–water heat exchanger driven by two pumps was studied under different flow configurations to understand how design and operating conditions affect performance.

This experiment replicates real engineering challenges such as maximizing heat transfer, minimizing losses, and understanding the role of flow arrangement. The focus was on comparing parallel flow, cross flow, and counter flow–like behavior, using temperature measurements from hot and cold water reservoirs.

2.Device Description and Components
Components Used:
Water–water heat exchanger, Two water pumps, Four water reservoirs (tupperware and insulated box), Immersion heater (hot reservoir), Ice and insulated cold reservoir, Styrofoam insulation, One thermocouple and four thermometers, Food dye (to visualize flow)

Qualitative Description
Hot water is circulated from a heated reservoir through one side of the heat exchanger while cold water is pumped from an insulated ice-water reservoir through the other side. Heat is transferred across the exchanger wall due to the temperature difference. The fluids exit into separate reservoirs where outlet temperatures are measured.

The system is open (mass crosses the system boundary) and operates approximately at steady state during each trial.

3.Experimental Setup

-Heat transfer occurs between the two flow channels  
-No intentional work interaction except pump work  
-Heat loss to surroundings is possible

4.System Diagram and Control Volume Analysis
Control Volume (CV)

The heat exchanger itself is selected as the control volume.

Mass flows:  
ṁ_hot in = ṁ_hot out  
ṁ_cold in = ṁ_cold out

Energy interactions:  
Heat transfer between hot and cold streams  
Minor heat loss to surroundings,Pump work external to CV
