Step 1: Consider the bar in your design to be rigid. Follow these steps to update your
portfolio page from HW5:
a Create sections to define the problem, your constraints/objectives, and your
design degrees of freedom.
b Treating the bar as rigid, revisit your submission for HW5 by describing the
static analysis you conducted to determine your final design.
c Present your final mechanism design in an image or drawing.
Step 2: The bar in your mechanism is no longer rigid. In fact, it is now best described as
a beam which bends due to the combined action of the weight and the actuator force.
Consider only the components of these forces transverse to your beam:
a Find the maximum deflection in your beam. State your assumptions clearly and
describe your analysis.
b Choose a beam design (cross-section, material) such that its vertical deflection is
below 2% of its length and is the most mass-efficient possible.
c Present your final beam design in an image or drawing.
